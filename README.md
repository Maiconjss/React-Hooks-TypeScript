<h2> Hooks studied: </h2>

<ul>

<li> useEffect </li>
<li> useMemo </li>
<li> useCallback </li>
<li> useRef </li>
<li> useContext </li>
<li> useImperativeHandle </li>
<li> useReducer </li>

</ul>

<h2> At the end of my studies I realized many advantages in using TypeScript and I will add it to most of my projects, when working together with Hooks the advantages are even greater and they avoid many problems! </h2>
